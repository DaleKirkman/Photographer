  <p>Weddings can go by so fast and there are a lot of things going on that you may miss.
    I look to make sure that this part of your wedding day goes as smoothly as possible, capturing those special memories that you can keep with you forever.
    <br>
  <p>Families are a huge part of our lives and I help to capture the fun side of families when doing family portraits. I have portable equipment that enables me to visit your home keeping the little ones
    confortable in their own environment.
    <br>
  <p>Having been passionate about Football for many years, I have helped with my local team, Trafford FC, and now cover various sports, such as American Football, and also numerous sporting events</p>
